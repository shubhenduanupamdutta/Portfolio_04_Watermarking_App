# Portfolio_04_Watermarking_App

## Fourth (04) Portfolio Project
## A GUI based desktop app, which adds a watermark to an image.
## The apps take location of the image as input.

## Mind you this implementation takes an png image as watermark file,and that is predefined. Since I made this for watermarking my images. 😁

## Limitations and requirements of the app
- This app was created on Windows, and hence optimized for windows
- Right now I have only tested with few jpg and png files, I don't know how it will behave with others.
- Watermark is a predefined image. If you clone repository you can use your own.
- Resultant watermarked image is saved one folder above the "main.py" file.
